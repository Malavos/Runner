## What this crazy thing does (or will do)?

This is a WPF application made with MahApps and a bunch of other cool libraries to help development. This is what it will do when it's finishedâ„¢:

- Run [Codeception](https://codeception.com/) tests, allowing teams to integrate unit testing, interface testing and BDD;
- Run pure [WebDriver/Selenium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver) tests. This is for more generic tests, and does not depends on Codeception to work.
- Install libraries, like [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator), [Coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet), [Selenium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone), NodeJS, [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). Ever wanted to deliver a faster product, installing all your environment with one click? This is it.
- Run XUnits tests and check their coverage. Ideal for WebApi's.
- Gather up reports on your tests. Scrum masters love those!
- Configure some global things for your tests. Wanna configure an default save directory for those evidence images? We will have you covered.
- Run tests in batch (Okay, this will be a bit tough to do, but [it will just work.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZFKWt3S2Ys))
